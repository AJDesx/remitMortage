 * Graceful shutdown with connection draining (issue #827).
 *
 * Deploys and scale-down events send SIGTERM. Instead of dying mid-request the
 * process:
 *
 *   1. flips to "shutting down", which fails the readiness probe immediately so
 *      the load balancer stops routing here;
 *   2. stops accepting new connections and lets in-flight requests finish
 *      (bounded by a timeout, after which stragglers are cut off);
 *   3. drains queue workers — a running job is allowed to finish; jobs still
 *      running at the timeout are put back on the queue so another replica
 *      picks them up instead of waiting for stall detection;
 *   4. closes the queues, Redis and the database last, once nothing can use
 *      them any more.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of `process.exit` and signal wiring so it
 * can be tested; src/index.ts owns those.
